##  Workflow Overview

### 1. Data Exploration & Audit

* Review the structure and content of the raw dataset
* Identify formatting inconsistencies, missing values, and irrelevant columns
* Define cleaning and transformation requirements

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Remove duplicates and unnecessary columns
* Standardize date formats, text casing, and number formats
* Handle missing data through logical imputation or removal
* Introduce **helper columns** for:

  * Date extraction (Month, Year)
  * Profit or margin calculations
  * Categorization or segmentation using `IF` conditions

### 3. Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables

* Summarize data using Pivot Tables to analyze:

  * Sales trends by product, region, or time
  * Profit distribution by category
  * Quantity sold over time
* Apply filters and sorting for targeted insights

### 4. Dashboard Design

* Create an interactive dashboard with:
* Pivot Charts (Bar, Line, Pie)
* Slicers for filtering by region, time, or category
* KPIs such as total sales, profit, and top-performing products
* Emphasize clarity, consistency, and usability through formatting and layout

##  Key Skills Demonstrated

* **Data Cleaning:** Text functions (`TRIM`, `PROPER`, `TEXT`), logical functions (`IF`, `ISBLANK`), handling missing values
* **Analytical Thinking:** Deriving insights from raw data using Pivot Tables
* **Dashboarding:** Creating visually appealing, interactive reports using charts and slicers
* **Excel Proficiency:** Mastery of core Excel tools for business analytics
